##DATA LEMUR Questions:

1)Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.


with cte_tweets
as (select user_id,count(tweet_id) as  tweet_count_per_user
    from tweets
    where tweet_date between '2022-01-01' and '2022-12-31'
    group by user_id
    )
select tweet_count_per_user as tweet_bucket, Count(user_id) as user_numbers
from cte_tweets
group by tweet_count_per_user;

2)Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.

Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the output by candidate ID in ascending order.

SELECT  candidate_id 
FROM candidates
where skill in ('Python','Tableau','PostgreSQL')
group by candidate_id
having count(skill)=3
order by candidate_id asc ;

3)Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.

from pages p 
LEFT JOIN  page_likes pl 
on p.page_id=pl.page_id
where liked_date IS NULL
order by p.page_id asc ;


4)Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:

parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.



SELECT PART, assembly_step
FROM parts_assembly 
where finish_date is NULL 
group by PART, assembly_step ;

5)Assume you are given the table below on Uber transactions made by users. Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user. Output the user id, spend and transaction date.

   FROM transactions
   )
select user_id,spend,transaction_date
from transcation_details
where row_num=3 ;


6)Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

SELECT 
sum(Case when device_type='laptop' then 1 else 0 end) as laptop_views,
sum(case when device_type in ('tablet','phone') then 1 else 0 end) as mobile_views
FROM viewership;


7)Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

SELECT user_id,(MAX(post_date::Date)-min(post_date::date)) as number_of_days
FROM posts
where Date_part('year',post_date::date)=2021
group by user_id
having COUNT(post_id)>1;

8)Write a query to identify the top 2 Power Users who sent the highest number of messages on Microsoft Teams in August 2022. Display the IDs of these 2 users along with the total number of messages they sent. Output the results in descending order based on the count of the messages.

SELECT sender_id, count(message_id) as message_count 
FROM messages
where EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sent_date) = '8'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) = '2022'
group by sender_id
ORDER BY message_count DESC
LIMIT 2;


9)Assume you're given a table containing job postings from various companies on the LinkedIn platform. Write a query to retrieve the count of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

Definition:

Duplicate job listings are defined as two job listings within the same company that share identical titles and descriptions.


 with finding_duplicate_jobposting 
as 
(SELECT company_id,title,description,COUNT(job_id) AS no_of_jobs
FROM job_listings
group by company_id,title,description)
select count(company_id) as company_duplicate_job_listings
from finding_duplicate_jobposting
where no_of_jobs>=2 ;


10)Assume you're given the tables containing completed trade orders and user details in a Robinhood trading system.

Write a query to retrieve the top three cities that have the highest number of completed trade orders listed in descending order. Output the city name and the corresponding number of completed trade orders.


SELECT u.city,count(t.order_id) as number_of_completed_trade_orders
FROM trades t  
JOIN users u   
on t.user_id=u.user_id
where t.status='Completed'
group by u.city
order by number_of_completed_trade_orders DESC
limit 3;


11)Given the reviews table, write a query to retrieve the average star rating for each product, grouped by month. The output should display the month as a numerical value, product ID, and average star rating rounded to two decimal places. Sort the output first by month and then by product ID.

FROM reviews
group by mth,product_id
order by mth,product_id;

12)Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:

Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.



select app_id,round(100.0 * SUM(case when event_type='click' then 1 else 0 end  )/
SUM(case when event_type='impression' then 1 else 0 end ),2) as ctr_rate
from events
